        <h3>Best Part</h3>
        <h5>by Daniel Caesar & H.E.R.</h5>

        <p><em>Intro</em><br>
        Oh, ay
        </p>
        <p><em>Verse 1</em><br>
        You don′t know, babe<br>
        When you hold me<br>
        And kiss me slowly<br>
        It's the sweetest thing<br>
        And it don′t change<br>
        If I had it my way<br>
        You would know that you are
        </p>
        <p><em>Pre-chorus</em><br>
        You're the coffee that I need in the morning<br>
        You're my sunshine in the rain when it′s pouring<br>
        Won′t you give yourself to me?<br>
        Give it all, oh
        </p>
        <p><em>Chorus</em><br>
        I just wanna see<br>
        I just wanna see how beautiful you are<br>
        You know that I see it, I know you're a star<br>
        Where you go, I′ll follow, no matter how far<br>
        If life is a movie, then you're the best part, oh<br>
        You′re the best part, ooh<br>
        Oh-oh-oh-oh<br>
        Best part
        </p>
        <p><em>Verse 2</em><br>
        It's this sunrise<br>
        And those brown eyes, yes<br>
        You′re the one that I desire<br>
        When we wake up<br>
        And then we make love (make love)<br>
        It makes me feel so nice
        </p>
        <p><em>Pre-chorus</em><br>
        You're my water when I'm stuck in the desert<br>
        You′re the Tylenol I take when my head hurts<br>
        You′re the sunshine on my life
        </p>
        <p><em>Chorus</em><br>
        I just wanna see how beautiful you are<br>
        You know that I see it, I know you're a star<br>
        Where you go, I′ll follow, no matter how far<br>
        If life is a movie, then you're the best part<br>
        Oh-oh-oh-oh<br>
        You′re the best part<br>
        Oh-oh-oh-oh<br>
        Best part (you're the best part)
        </p>
        <p><em>Hook</em><br>
        If you love me, won′t you say something?<br>
        If you love me, won't you, won't you?<br>
        If you love me, won′t you say something? (Say something)<br>
        If you love me, won′t you?<br>
        Love me, won't you?<br>
        If you love me, won′t you say something? (Say something)<br>
        If you love me, won't you? Ah<br>

        If you love me, won't you?<br>
        Love me, won′t you?<br>
        If you love me, won't you say something? (Say something)<br>
        If you love me, won't you? Ah<br>
